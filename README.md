# Bucket-List-Tracker
Bucket list tracker application using AWS Amplify, React, GraphQL, AWS AppSync, and DynamoDB

## Project Overview

This project guides you through deploying a simple Bucket List Tracker application using AWS Amplify. The application will allow users to add, view, and delete items from their bucket list, with authentication features for secure user management. learn how to create a React application, set up authentication, and manage backend services using AWS AppSync and DynamoDB. The project is cost-free, falling within AWS Free Tier limits.

# Step 1: Create and Upload the React Application
Create a React Application:

Use create-react-app to scaffold a new React application.

Design a simple UI that allows users to add, view, and delete items from their bucket list.

npx create-react-app bucket-list-tracker
cd bucket-list-tracker

Initialize a GitHub Repository:

Create a new repository on GitHub and push your React application code.

git init
git remote add origin <your-github-repo-url>
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git push -u origin main

# Step 2: Host the React Application on AWS Amplify
Connect GitHub Repository to AWS Amplify:

Log in to the AWS Amplify console.
Connect your GitHub repository to Amplify.
Follow the prompts to deploy your application.

Verify Deployment:

After deployment, Amplify will provide a URL where you can view your hosted React application.

# Step 3: Configure the Backend Using Amplify Studio or CLI
Install and Configure Amplify CLI:

Install Amplify CLI if not already installed.

npm install -g @aws-amplify/cli
Configure Amplify for your project.
bash
Copy code
amplify init

Set Up Backend Resources:

Use Amplify Studio or CLI to set up backend resources like authentication, API, and storage.

# Step 4: Implement User Authentication
Add Authentication with Amplify:

Configure authentication using Amplify CLI.

amplify add auth
amplify push
Integrate Authentication into React App:

Modify your React app to include authentication components (login, signup, logout).

# Step 5: Create a GraphQL API Using AWS AppSync
Add GraphQL API:

Use Amplify CLI to create a GraphQL API.

amplify add api
amplify push
Define GraphQL Schema:

Create a schema to define bucket list items and set up CRUD operations.

# Step 6: Integrate GraphQL API with DynamoDB
Connect GraphQL API to DynamoDB:

Configure your GraphQL API to use DynamoDB as the data source.
Automatically create DynamoDB tables based on the schema.
Test CRUD Operations:

Ensure Create, Read, and Delete operations work as expected in the application.

# Step 7: Final Testing and Application Deployment
Test Full Workflow:

Test the entire application, from authentication to bucket list management.
Deploy Final Application:

Make necessary code modifications.
Deploy the final version using AWS Amplifyâ€™s CI/CD features.
